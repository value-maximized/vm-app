# VM-App, Strategy & Operations Planner - Business App
An app to help managers focus on making better decisions &amp; delivering projects with higher ROI.




🔭 I’m developing an open-source **SOP** _**Strategy & Operations Planner**_  - an app to help ELT (executive leadership teams) plan business better & faster.

## Why SOP apps matter?

In today’s fast-changing environment, CEOs and executive teams often struggle to connect strategy with execution because ERP systems focus on transactions, not decisions. IBP bridges that gap by turning ERP data into executive-ready insights, linking strategy, operations, and finance in one place. It gives leaders the ability to see "what is" their standing performance today, explore “what if” scenarios for tomorrow, and understand the trade-offs of capital, people, and market choices. By uniting planning and performance review, IBP empowers organizations to move faster, allocate resources smarter, and build a lasting competitive advantage.
